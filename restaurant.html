									<h3 class="major">What is the challenge?</h3>
									<p>Poplars Fish Bar is a small fish and chips takeaway and restaurant business looking to expand their digital outreach by having a business website. The aim of this case study is to demonstrate how good UX is important when designing a website for a small local business competing in a wide market space.</p>

									<h4>The Problem</h4>
									<p>Poplars Fish Bar, as of writing this case study, does not have a website that users can view. It is important to include user-centric design principles based on the end user’s resources. In the case of website design, the resources typically used are desktop computers, laptops, tablets and mobile devices.</p>
									<p>The initial website design will be done based on a desktop/ laptop experience. This framework can then be used to design the website based on a tablet or mobile device viewing experience.</p>

							
									<h3 class="major">Goals and Motivations</h3>
									<h4>Goals for the Design</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>To design a new website that looks modern.</li>
										<li>To give users easy access to what they want without making them think.</li>
										<li>To help the restaurant get more table bookings.</li>
									</ul>

									<h4>Personal goals</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>To enhance my understanding of different UX design elements, specifically for increasing business conversion rates.</li>
										<li>Take ownership of the various roles involved in designing the website.</li>
									</ul>


									<h3 class="major">Understanding the Users Through User Interviews</h3>
									<h4>User Demographic</h4>
									<p>Poplars Fish Bar is located next to a popular and well established UK supermarket, therefore there would be a large range of users accessing the website.</p>
									
									<p>The business has stated that their users are generally:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Adults who want a quick meal after work.</li>
										<li>Adults who want a meal before/ after shopping.</li>
										<li>OAPs (old age pensioners) who want to have a meal with friends and family.</li>
										<li>Young adults who want to meet up and have a meal with friends.</li>
									</ul>


									<h4>Conducting User Interviews</h4>
									<p>The best way of understanding the needs of the user is to ask them what they are looking for when viewing a restaurant website. The main goal of the interviews was to see what elements of the website are core features in order to increase table booking numbers.</p>

									<p>Ten interviews were conducted on people who matched the business’ general user demographic. To get more consistent results, the users were shown an image of a similar business’ website and asked various questions based on the website.</p>
									
									<p>Some of the insights from the user interviews:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Most users wanted a clear and easy to read website.</li>
										<li>Viewing the menu on the website was the feature most often used by the majority of the users.</li>
										<li>Most users wanted a way to contact the business.</li>
										<li>The majority of users wanted a way to make a restaurant reservation.</li>
									</ul>


									<h3 class="major">Competitor Analysis</h3>
									<p>From the user interviews, a few touch points were found which can be used to research competitors’ websites on their approach to the user experience. A majority of the local competitors do not have a website to compare with. Therefore, more established locations within London (Poppie’s, Fishers and The Golden Hind) were used to compare with those local competitors (Day’s, The Fish and Chip Shop and the Old Town Fish Bar) who did have a website.</p>
									<p>A feature analysis was conducted on the websites to quantify the differences between the competitors.</p>
									<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><center><img src="images/res/res_spreadsheet.jpg" alt="" style="width:60%; height:60%" /></center>
										<center><p style="font-size:0.9em"><i>Table of direct competitors.</i></p></center>
									</span></div>

									<p>From a glance of the table you could assume that all the websites are similar since they mostly include the most important features. However, the way the websites displays the features and its relevant information is vastly different. For example, from the table, it shows that The Fish and Chip Shop was the only website which had an opening hour tab. However, all of the other websites, apart from the Old Town Fish Bar, had their opening hours displayed either on their homepage, booking tab and/or the contact us tab.</p>
									<p>The table also shows how much emphasis each business puts into their social media. With so many options around, social media marketing can easily persuade and entice users to visit a particular business. The established businesses located in London promote their social media and use it as a tool to increase booking numbers. The local competitors have not yet tapped into that market, however, that could be due to other factors such as the cost of running a social media page.</p>


									<h3 class="major">Personas</h3>
									<p>From the user demographic, I created three personas which matched the general business customer. These personas are used to effectively communicate the insights gathered through my research so far.</p>
									<p>The first persona is named Karen. She is a primary persona, and therefore a strong representation in the goals and needs of the users for the website.</p>

									<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><center><img src="images/res/res_persona_karen.jpg" alt="" style="width:50%; height:50%" /></center>
										<center><p style="font-size:0.9em"><i>Persona 1: Karen</i></p></center>
									</span></div>
									
									<p>The next persona is Deborah, she fits in the same user demographic, however, users at her age rarely use technology to access information. It is important to understand her goals and needs since there will be many different users of the website. In particular, Deborah needs the website to be legible so that she can read any information easily.</p>
									<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><center><img src="images/res/res_persona_deborah.jpg" alt="" style="width:50%; height:50%" /></center>
										<center><p style="font-size:0.9em"><i>Persona 2: Deborah</i></p></center>
									</span></div>

									<p>Finally, the last persona is Anthony, he is an atypical user to the website. Anthony is a student and therefore on a fixed budget when looking at restaurants. He specifically needs to see the menu and price before committing to a restaurant.</p>
									<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><center><img src="images/res/res_persona_anthony.jpg" alt="" style="width:50%; height:50%" /></center>
										<center><p style="font-size:0.9em"><i>Persona 3: Anthony</i></p></center>
									</span></div>

									<h3 class="major">Ideation and Design</h3>
									<h4>Proposed Solutions</h4>
									<p>From the research conducted in the previous sections, we can now find a solution to the user’s needs. Therefore, the Poplars Fish Bar website needs to be designed so that:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>The site is easy to navigate.</li>
										<li>The text is clear and easy to read.</li>
										<li>A menu with prices is easily accessible.</li>
										<li>The shop's address/ location and opening hours can easily be found.</li>
									</ul>

									<h4>Paper Sketches</h4>
									<p>For the paper wireframes, it is important to set out the right foundations so that there are no missing elements in higher fidelity prototypes. To discover what the necessary elements were for each page, I went through the UI of various local and national restaurants. From these necessary elements a list of requirements was compiled. The list was then used to sketch different possible layouts and solutions, iterating between different versions to find the best version.</p>

										<center><p style="font-size:0.9em"><i>Example of paper sketches</i></p></center>
									</span></div>

									<h3 class="major">UX Suggestions and the Redesign</h3>
									<p>With the help of my background research and paper wireframes I was then able to build medium and high fidelity prototypes.</p>
									<h4>"Home" Screen</h4>
									<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><center><img src="images/res/res_home_p1.jpg" alt="" style="width:50%; height:50%" /></center>
										<center><p style="font-size:0.9em"><i>Desktop and mobile "Home" screen mockups.</i></p></center>
									</span></div>

									<h4>"About Us" Screen</h4>
									<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><center><img src="images/res/res_about_p1.jpg" alt="" style="width:50%; height:50%" /></center>
										<center><p style="font-size:0.9em"><i>Desktop and mobile "About Us" screen mockups.</i></p></center>
									</span></div>

									<h4>"Menu" Screen</h4>
									<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><center><img src="images/res/res_menu_p1.jpg" alt="" style="width:50%; height:50%" /></center>
										<center><p style="font-size:0.9em"><i>Desktop and mobile "Menu" screen mockups.</i></p></center>
									</span></div>

									<h4>"Bookings" Screen</h4>
									<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><center><img src="images/res/res_res_p1.jpg" alt="" style="width:50%; height:50%" /></center>
										<center><p style="font-size:0.9em"><i>Desktop and mobile "Bookings" screen mockups.</i></p></center>
									</span></div>

									<h4>"Contact Us" Screen</h4>
									<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><center><img src="images/res/res_contact_p1.jpg" alt="" style="width:50%; height:50%" /></center>
										<center><p style="font-size:0.9em"><i>Desktop and mobile "Contact Us" screen mockups.</i></p></center>
									</span></div>
									
									<h3 class="major">Validation Testing</h3>
									<p>To validate the website's design, I surveyed 10 people with my prototype. To test the performance and usability of the website, 10 questions on the features were given to the survey participants.</p>
									<h4>Successes</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>All users found navigating the website easy with the help of the navigation bar/ menu.</li>
										<li>Most users found that the text was clear and easy to read.</li>
										<li>The majority of users were able to find the restaurant's address within thirty seconds of asking.</li>
										<li>All of the users were able to find the menu with prices within ten seconds of asking.</li>
									</ul>

									<h4>Pain Points</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>A small number of users found that there was not a clear distinction between the page's content and the navigation bar/ footer.</li>
										<li>Some users found that the map on the “Contact Us” mobile screen is not large enough.</li>
										<li>Some users complained that there was no option to make a booking over the phone on the “Bookings” screen.</li>
									</ul>

									<h3 class="major">Iterations</h3>
									<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><center><img src="images/res/res_contact_it.jpg" alt="" style="width:50%; height:50%" /></center></span></div>

									<h4>Problem 1- Visual Clarity</h4>
									<p>Despite the majority of the website being visually clear, there were a small number of users who thought that the lack of distinction between the page's content and the navigation bar/ footer was problematic.</p>
									<p>Solution- Place a line between the page's main content and the navigation bar/ footer.</p>

									<h4>Problem 2- Mobile Map Size</h4>
									<p>On the desktop version of the website the map was large enough so that all necessary information can be incorporated in the map. However, scaling the map for mobile did not translate well due to the smaller screen size.</p>
									<p>Solution- Make the map size larger so that all necessary information is legible.</p>

									<h4>Problem 3- Phone Bookings</h4>
									<p>On the prototype's “Bookings” screen the only way to book a table is to fill in the online form. This was mainly a pain point for the elderly since they typically do not have access to any email.</p>
									<p>Solution- Made it clear on the “Bookings” screen that bookings can be made over the phone.</p>

									<h3 class="major">What was the Main Challenge in the Project?</h3>
									<p>The most challenging part of the project was finding the balance between the user needs and the business needs when determining where to place certain elements on the screen.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Reflection and Lessons Learned</h3>
									<p>When starting the case study, I was nervous as designing a website from scratch is a new experience for me. At the same time it was also exciting to know that designing the website will challenge me and make me think of different thought processes when progressing through the case study.</p>
									<p>Looking back at the whole process, I noticed that it was important to research as much as possible, so that it makes finding a solution to the design problem easier. The research phase of the case study is arguably the backbone of the redesign and without it, a successful solution cannot be found.</p>
