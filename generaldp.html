							<h2>Double Diamond Method</h2>
							<h3>Discover</h3>
								<ul>
									<p>The first diamond helps with understanding the problem, rather than making assumptions. For both UX and illustrations, this involves speaking to and spending time with people who best know the issue.</p>
								</ul>

							<h3>Define</h3>
								<ul>
									<p>The insights gathered from the discovery phase can help you to define the challenge in a different way. For UX this involves setting out the pain points and user needs of the current system. Similar to UX, for illustrations, a set of specifications for the designs are drafted to the clients needs.</p>
								</ul>

							<h3>Develop</h3>
								<ul>
									<p>The second diamond encourages people to give different answers to the clearly defined problem, seeking inspiration from elsewhere and co-designing with a range of different people. Both UX and illustrations require sketches, however where UX also includes wireframes and iterations, illustrations incorporate colour mapping.</p>
								</ul>

							<h3>Deliver</h3>
								<ul>
									<p>Delivery involves testing out different solutions at small-scale, rejecting those that will not work and improving the ones that will. UX and illustrations are different in the delivery process as with UX, this is done by interactive prototyping. Whereas, for illustrations, the delivery involves rough sketches with colour.</p>
								</ul>

							<p>This is not a linear process as the arrows on the diagram show. As you progress through the design process more about the underlying problems is learnt, which can send you back to the very beginning. Making and testing very early stage ideas can be part of discovery. And in an ever-changing and digital world, no idea is ever “finished”. We are constantly getting feedback on how products and services are working and iteratively improving on them.</p>

							<h2>The Design Principles</h2>
							<p>The framework for innovation outlines four core principles for problem solvers to adopt so that they can work as effectively as possible.</p>

							<ul>
								<li><b>Put people first.</b> Start with an understanding of the people using a service, their needs, strengths and aspirations.</li>
								<li><b>Communicate visually and inclusively.</b> Help people gain a shared understanding of the problem and ideas.</li>
								<li><b>Collaborate and co-create.</b> Work together and get inspired by what others are doing.</li>
								<li><b>Iterate, iterate, iterate.</b> Do this to sport errors early, avoid risk and build confidence in your ideas.</li>
							</ul>

							<h2>The Methods Bank</h2>
							<p>The following design methods are used to identify and address any challenges and achieve successful outcomes.</p>
							<ul>
								<li><b>Explore:</b> challenges, needs and opportunities</li>
								<li><b>Shape:</b> prototypes, insight and visions</li>
								<li><b>Build:</b> ideas, plans and expertise</li>
							</ul>

							<h2>Creating a Culture of Success</h2>
							<p>The problems we face today require more than one idea, they require working with others and supporting people to be part of the solution. As important as the process and principles we adopt, is the team's culture and how it connects with citizens and partners.</p>
							<p><b>Leadership</b> is needed to encourage innovation, build skills and capability, provide permission for experimentation and learning. Strong leadership also allows projects to be open and agile, showing results along the way and being able to change.</p>
							<p><b>Engagement</b> is needed with people who are delivering the ideas and receiving them, but also with other partners who might have other ideas. Developing connections and building relationships is as important as creating ideas.</p>
